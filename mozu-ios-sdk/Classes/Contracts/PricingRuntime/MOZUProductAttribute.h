An attribute value type is either predefined vocabulary by the admin during attribute set up or user-defined with an appropriate type (AdminEntered or ShopperEntered depending on the user). These types are used by products and attributes. The difference between predefined values versus manually entered values is such that the first choice is a set of options to choose from. AdminEntered and ShopperEntered are values that are entered rather than system-supplied and are not stored in the database, but captured during a live commerce operations such as during an order.
