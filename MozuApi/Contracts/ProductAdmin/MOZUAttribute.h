	Details of the property such as its name and description, whether it is a configurable option, and how many products have this attribute. A product detail that a merchant can define to add to the product base type. Define details, such as specifications, to describe products. Create attributes to share across several or all products in a store or stores such as price, size, weight, color, and brand.  Some attributes will apply to a specific type of product or a single product, for example, screen resolution or storage capacity.  Create attributes separately from products to share common attributes across products.
