/**
Retrieves a list of events according to any specified filter criteria and sort options.
@param filter A set of expressions that consist of a field, operator, and value and represent search parameter syntax when filtering results of a query. Valid operators include equals (eq), does not equal (ne), greater than (gt), less than (lt), greater than or equal to (ge), less than or equal to (le), starts with (sw), or contains (cont). For example - "filter=IsDisplayed+eq+true"
@param pageSize The number of results to display on each page when creating paged results from a query. The amount is divided and displayed on the `pageCount `amount of pages. The default is 20 and maximum value is 200 per page.
@param responseFields Use this field to include those fields which are not included by default.
@param sortBy The element to sort the results by and the channel in which the results appear. Either ascending (a-z) or descending (z-a) channel. Optional.
@param startIndex When creating paged results from a query, this value indicates the zero-based offset in the complete result set where the returned entities begin. For example, with a `pageSize `of 25, to get the 51st through the 75th items, use `startIndex=3`.
